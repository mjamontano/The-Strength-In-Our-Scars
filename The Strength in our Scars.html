                <p class="p">When we say <b>contrast</b>, it is something that comes with a difference or comparison between two things. I do believe that everything comes into two ways: it's either you will go to this or to that. The important thing to remember here is that, do not expect that it will always come to your preferred way. Learn how to accept that it will not always be in your favor. If in case your route came to disappointment, do not let it discourage you, instead let it be your stepping stone for becoming even stronger as to how you were before. Turn negativities into your positivities, that's how we are going to survive whatever challenges may come into our way.</p>

                  <h2>Reader's Digest</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="p">As the saying goes, <b>"When we are at our lowest point, we are open for the greatest change."</b> Sometimes, we are not seeing the importance of something that we have unless we lost it. The emptiness that we are feeling to that particular entity enables us to have a room for something more valuable than what we have before. So, do not fear the rebuilding process. It is a crucial moment for each one of us as it will be a vital process in our growth as an individual. We may get discouraged along the way as there will be point in time that we will be having flashbacks, but we must see it instead as a reminder that we can become stronger because of what already happened in the past. Continue to strive to move forward; you may look back into the past, but be careful not to go back. Take it as a precautionary measure so that you will not be able to repeat the same mistake twice.</p>

                <p class="p">To me, it doesn't matter what your <b>MBTI Personality</b> designation is. What matters is if at some point, we had an alignment of our thoughts / ideas. Whether directly / indirectly, all of us has the capacity to move people. We can inspire them by how we get things done, we can stimulate their minds through engagement and exchange of opinions, and the capacity to stir their thoughts making them think twice and have the benefit of the doubt over something. That magical aspect may seem to be intagible, but it is clearly visible in a lot of ways. That's how we can have an impact into other people's lives.</p>
